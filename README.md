# What is this all about?
  This tool is based on biorhythms, that is pseudo-science. 
  It calculates when your students are most intelligent and then suggests you to teach them advanced topic at the moment when their intelligent ability is increasing.
  


# Bonus

This may vary but atleast you can assume that our behaviours repeat over-and-over like value of sinusodial functions.
